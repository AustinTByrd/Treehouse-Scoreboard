# Treehouse Scoreboard Mini-Project

## About
I did a neat little mini React project of a player scoreboard while learning React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to describe how your app should be displayed in a very easy to understand way. It also helps eliminate the complexity that comes with updating your DOM elements when the user interacts with your application.

## What I Mastered
-[x] JSX <br>
-[x] State Influencers<br>
-[x] Components<br>

## What's Next?
This was a nice little peak into building stateful components. I think the next project I'm going to tackle is building an Instagram mockup. Once I have it built, I'll attempt to implement some kind of redesign.

  <h3>Players can be added and and scores can go into the negative</h3>
  <img src="/scoreboard-2.png" />
  
  <br>
  
  <h3>Players can be deleted and the array still works because we added ID's</h3>
